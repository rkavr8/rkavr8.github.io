                <h2>Fortnite</h2>
                <p>Fornite is a great game for families to play together. You can create teams of up to 4 players and battle it out with other teams. If one player is younger or less experienced, they can be healed or rebooted if they die by other teammates. </p>

                <h2>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</h2>
                <p>If you have younger fans of the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, this is a great game for them. There is a lot of strategy involved, but younger players and enjoy this hack-and-slash game just as must as adults. While one player focuses on achieving key objectives, the other can slaughter the masses of enemies.</p>

                <h2>Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</h2>
                <p>Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe is a great game to play with younger children. Once you've unlocked the "Nabbit" character, younger players can play as Nabbit. Nabbit does not get injured by enemies and doesn't drown, which makes it easier for younger players to beat levels. Additionally, when playing in multiplayer mode, younger players can "bubble" so the more experienced player can navigate the complicated areas.</p>

                <h2>Minecraft</h2>
                <p>Minecraft can be played on split-screen or by joining a friends world. Both are options that do not require an additional fee like their realms option. Minecraft is a great game for younger players as you can set your world to "Peaceful" mode to prevent hostile mobs from spawning. Players can learn the game and even build in creative mode. It allows for increased difficulty as the player gets more experienced.</p>
                <p>Minecraft is also a great platform for teaching kids to code! From entering "cheat commands" to build your own mods, the possibilities are endless! Here's an example of a command code:</p>
                <pre>/summon mob</pre>
                <pre>/give [player] [item] [quantity]</pre>
