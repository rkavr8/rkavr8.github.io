                <h2>Things All Gaming Parents Should Know</h2>
                <p>Gaming can be a fun hobby for people of all ages. However, when you have younger children, parents must be aware of the dangers of gaming and do their due diligence before letting their kids play. We've outlined some of the best practices all parents should take before allowing their child to play any game. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Check Content Ratings</li>
                        <p class="list-paragraph">Content ratings vary based on creator, platform, and even where you live. Sometimes, the best way to determine if the content is appropriate for your child, is to read reviews and game descriptions. Some games that may be suitable for other kids the same age, may be too scary for others. Check the ratings and then do your own research to determine if the game aligns with your level of appropriateness.</p>
                    <li>Review Parental Controls for Online Games</li>
                        <p class="list-paragraph">Online gaming can be dangerious and can easily expose young children to inappropriate content. If you child will be playing online, make sure to review how to limit their ability to interact with others online. Most systems allow you to set parental controls that prevent adding friends without permission, talking to anyone outside your friend list, and even muting all other players permanently. </p>
                    <li>Play Together First!</li>
                        <p class="list-paragraph">The best way to tell if a game is appropriate, is to play it yourself first. If you can play together, great! If not, play a few rounds or levels on your own to get a feel for the difficulty level and content. If you don't want to purchase a game first, you can always rent it or play a preview.</p>
                    <li>Monitor Play Time</li>
                        <p class="list-paragraph">It's hard - I know. We all love to game. But too much gaming can cause kids to become impatient and disconnected. Make sure to place limits on video gaming and encourage other games like sports, card games, board games, etc. Getting away from the screen is important and teaches kids how to manage their time and frustrations. Especially when there's a boss they just can't beat!</p>
