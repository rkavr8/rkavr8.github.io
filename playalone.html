                <h2>The Best Games For Kids (and Parents) to Play Alone</h2>
                <p>As much fun as it is to play together - parents typically can't spend all day gaming with their kids. Therefore, here are some of our top picks for gaming alone. A lot of the games mentioned in the "Play Together" page can also be played individually but the following games are specifically single player.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li>
                    <li>Pokemon</li>
                    <li>Super Mario Odyssey</li>
                    <li>Roblox</li>

                <h2>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h2>
                <p>We <span style="font-weight: bold;">love</span> Breath of the Wild. The gameplay can be whatever you want it to be. Younger players can enjoy exploring, shield surfing, horseback riding, etc. while other, more experience players, can change themselves in Master Mode. However, keep in mind that if younger players actually want to purse any side quests, there is a good amount of reading required so some parental assistance may be needed.</p>

                <h2>Pokemon</h2>
                <p>There are A LOT of Pokemon games out there. From the console to the tablet to the game board, Pokemon is everywhere. However, here we are specifically referring to the video games. Pokemon video games are always great for young kids as the gameplay is pretty simple. Young gamers can play the easier areas and catch Pokemon to their heart's content without experiencing too much frustration. There is a good amount of reading involved so some parental assistance may be required.</p>

                <h2>Super Mario Odyssey</h2>
                <p>Super Mario Odyssey is great for the beginner gamer. Technically you can play two-player but it's clumsy and not really helpful for the younger players. But the controls are simple, and the game can be as easy or complex as you want. Young players can play alone and explore the easier words as they build their confidence and skill level.</p>

                <h2>Roblox</h2>
                <p>Now, Roblox has it's cautions (see our Parent Need to Know page for more) but it is a great game for young players. It requires very little reading and is very intuitive. Most young kids play the game on their tablet devices, it is easy to setup, and free (for the most part).</p>
